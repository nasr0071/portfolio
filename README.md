# portfolio

**Tell us about your process, challenges you faced during development and how you overcame those changes. What have you learned by creating your web portfolio?**

Starting this assignment was a bit of a challenge since my initial website design was very complex. I had to simplify my layout since it felt over complicated and hid some content depending on the layout. Some text was very small and hard to read so I had to enlarge the font size. I struggled with redesigning the layout and made some changes as I went. I prefer my current website design over my original since it's more functional, minimal, and more visually pleasing.

The main issue I struggled with when writing the code is changing the default colours. I ended up creating different variables and adding an “!important” rule in the css to override any default styling set by bootstrap. 

I learnt how easy and simple it is to use bootstrap and how much time it can save by simplifying the styling process. Using external sources like animate.css are effective tools that make the site visually more appealing.
